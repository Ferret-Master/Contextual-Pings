for a long time I have felt that the current ping system of pa is a bit limited and difficult to communicate intentions when you're not in voice.

This mod attempts to solve that issue by adding a variety of additional pings.

The features that these pings have are:
Animated models to represent the ping
Coloured ping circle effects to match the models
Related sound effects for each type of ping
Ties in to the alert system to give the same type of alert as a normal ping would.
can be global or team only
The main features are:
The ability to create a contextual ping at your cursors location with a keypress
A moveable menu that you can select the pings from
An audio toggle on the action bar if you don't like the noises or someone is spamming
A reasonable amount of spam protection
The current selection of pings are shield(defend here), sword(attack here), money(eco here), commander(a commander was here),anti-nuke(build an anti-nuke here) ,and the only current global is a white flag(peace).

There are plans to add more pings/features, particularly a few more global ones.
